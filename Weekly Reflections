week1 - I found this quite simple as I had done this work and understood it last year
week 2 - same as before, i had submitted this last year but I went through my code an made edits where i thought helped and made the code better
week 3 - same as above
week 4 - same as above
week 5 - I found this a little more difficult as I didn't finish my code for this last year so it took mea little while 
week 6 - I had to start from scratch on this one, and found it difficult but interesting to use the new concepts
